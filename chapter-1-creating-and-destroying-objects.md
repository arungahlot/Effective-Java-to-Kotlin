## Item 1: Static Factory Methods

A simple static method that returns an instance of the class. Implemented in Kotlin using [Object declarations.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/object-declarations.html)

> The key idea of the static factory method is to gain control over object creation and delegate it from constructor to static method. The decision of object to be created is like in Abstract Factory made outside the method \(in the common case, but not always\). While the key \(!\) idea of Factory Method is to delegate the decision of what instance of the class to create inside Factory Method.

#### Pros

* Named "constructors".
* Do not have to create new instances every time - Can return null, if appropriate.
* Return an object of any subtype of their return type - Can return an instance of a derived class, if appropriate.
* Reduces the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances.

#### Cons

* Classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.

```kotlin
private constructor(private val model: String,
    private val brand: Brand,
    private val maxSpeed: Int? ,
    private val hp: Int?,
    private val torque: Int?,
    private val seating: Int?,
    private val mileage: Int?) {

  companion object {

    fun valueOf(model: String,
                brand: Brand,
                maxSpeed: Int?,
                hp: Int?,
                torque: Int?,
                seating: Int?,
                mileage: Int?): Car {
      return Car(model, brand, maxSpeed, hp, torque, seating, mileage)
    }
  }
```

#### Common names

* valueOf
* of
* getInstance
* newInstance
* getType
* newType

## Item 2: Builder Pattern

This pattern is used when designing classes whose constructors may have more than a handful of parameters. They also simulate the behavior of named optional parameters which are available in Kotlin.

> In most cases, you don't need to use builders in Kotlin since we have default and named arguments. But it is nice to have.

#### Rules of Thumb

* Sometimes creational patterns are complementary: Builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components get built. Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype can use Singleton in their implementations.

* Builder focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. Abstract Factory emphasizes a family of product objects \(either simple or complex\). Builder returns the product as a final step, but as far as the Abstract Factory is concerned, the product gets returned immediately.

* Builder often builds a Composite.

* Often, designs start out using Factory Method \(less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate\) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder \(more flexible, more complex\) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.

```kotlin
class Vacation (val destination: String?, val duration: Int, val mode: Mode, val cost: Int) {

  private constructor(builder: Vacation.Builder) : this(builder.destination, builder.duration, builder.mode, builder.cost)

  companion object {
    inline fun build(mode: Mode, cost: Int, block: Vacation.Builder.() -> Unit) = Vacation.Builder(mode, cost).apply(block).build()
  }

  class Builder(val mode: Mode,val cost: Int) {
    var destination: String? = null
    var duration: Int = 0

    fun build() = Vacation(this)
  }
}
```

## Item 3: Singleton Pattern

Used in order to ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. But this is mostly considered an Anti-pattern in the OOD community because of its behavior in relation to the design principles.

> The private constructor is used to ensuring this class canâ€™t be initialized anywhere except inside of this class.

#### Pros

* Lazy initialization
* Thread safe \(Use of static block to instantiate object\)
* Static Initialization

#### Cons

* Hides dependencies in the code rather than exposing it through interfaces.
* Has its own lifetime and so making it [difficult to test](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/17/singletons-are-pathological-liars/)
* They violate the single responsibility principle: by virtue of the fact that they control their own creation and lifecycle.
* Produces tightly coupled code.

#### Rules of Thumb

* Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype can use Singleton in their implementation.

* Facade objects are often Singletons because only one Facade object is required.

* State objects are often Singletons.

* The advantage of Singleton over global variables is that you are absolutely sure of the number of instances when you use Singleton, and, you can change your mind and manage any number of instances.

* The Singleton design pattern is one of the most inappropriately used patterns. Singletons are intended to be used when a class must have exactly one instance, no more, no less. Designers frequently use Singletons in a misguided attempt to replace global variables. A Singleton is, for intents and purposes, a global variable. The Singleton does not do away with the global; it merely renames it.

* When is Singleton unnecessary? Short answer: most of the time. Long answer: when it's simpler to pass an object resource as a reference to the objects that need it, rather than letting objects access the resource globally. The real problem with Singletons is that they give you such a good excuse not to think carefully about the appropriate visibility of an object. Finding the right balance of exposure and protection for an object is critical for maintaining flexibility.

## Item 4: Non-instantiability using Private Constructors

In order to ensure non-instantiability of a class, a private constructor might come in handy. Using this we can make sure that we only instantiate the class when absolutely required using a factory or builder pattern.

Utility classes are not designed to be instantiated: an instance would be nonsensical. In the absence of explicit constructors, however, the compiler provides a public, parameterless default constructor. To a user, this constructor is indistinguishable from any other. It is not uncommon to see unintentionally instantiable classes in published APIs.

> There is, however, a simple idiom to ensure noninstantiability. A default constructor is generated only if a class contains no explicit constructors, so a class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.

#### Cases

* To prevent instantiation outside of the object in
  * Singleton
  * Factory Method
  * Static-methods-only \(utility\) class
  * Constants-only class
